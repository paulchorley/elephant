def corrcoef(binned_sts, clip=False):
    '''
    Calculate the NxN matrix of pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients
    between all combinations given a N binned spike trains.

    For each pair of spike trains $(i,j)$ in the list, the correlation
    coefficient $C[i, j]$ is given by the correlation coefficient between the
    vectors obtained by binning $i$ and $j$ at the desired bin size. Let $b_i$
    and $b_j$ denote the binary vectors and $m_i$ and  $m_j$ their respective
    averages. Then

    .math $$ C[i,j] = <b_i-m_i, b_j-m_j> /
                      \sqrt{<b_i-m_i, b_i-m_i>*<b_j-m_j,b_j-m_j>} $$

    where <..,.> is the scalar product of two vectors.

    For an input of n spike trains, a n x n matrix is returned.
    Each entry in the matrix is a real number ranging between -1 (perfectly
    anti-correlated spike trains) and +1 (perfectly correlated spike trains).

    If clip is True, the binned spike trains are clipped before computing the
    correlation coefficients, so that the binned vectors b_i, b_j are binary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binned_sts : elephant.conversion.Binned
        A binned spike train class containing the spike trains to be evaluated.
    clip : bool, optional
        If True, two spikes of the a particular spike train falling in the same
        bin are counted as 1, resulting in binary binned vectors b_i. If False,
        the binned vectors $b_i$ contain the actually spike counts.
        Default: False

    Returns
    -------
    C : ndarrray
        The square matrix of correlation coefficients. The element
        $C[i,j]=C[j,i]$ is the Pearson's correlation coefficient between
        binned_sts[i] and binned_sts[j]. If binned_sts contains only one
        SpikeTrain, C=1.0.

    Notes
    -----
    * The spike trains in the binned structure are assumed to all cover the
      complete time span of binned_sts [t_start,t_stop).

    Computes the cross-correlation histogram (CCH) between two binned

    Parameters
    ----------
    x,y : binned_st
        binned spike trains. If ndarrays, they are interpreted as sequences
        of zero (no spike) and non-zero (one or more spikes) values.
    hlen : int or None (optional)
        histogram half-length. If specified, the cross-correlation histogram
        has a number of bins equal to 2*hlen+1 (up to the maximum length).
        If not specified, the full crosscorrelogram is returned
        Default: None
    corrected : bool (optional)
        whether to correct for the border effect. If True, the value of the
        CCH at bin b (for b=-H,-H+1, ...,H, where H is the CCH half-length)
        is multiplied by the correction factor:
                            (H+1)/(H+1-|b|),
        which linearly corrects for loss of bins at the edges.
        Default: False
    smooth : Quantity or None (optional)
        if smooth is a positive time, each bin in the raw cross-correlogram
        is averaged over a window (-smooth/2, +smooth/2) with the values in
        the neighbouring bins. If smooth <= w, no smoothing is performed.
        Default: None
    clip : bool (optional)
        whether to clip spikes from the same spike train falling in the
        same bin. If True, such spikes are considered as a single spike;
        otherwise they are considered as different spikes.
        Default: False.
    normed : bool (optional)
        whether to normalize the central value (corresponding to time lag
        0 s) to 1; the other values are rescaled accordingly.
        Default: False
    kernel : str or array (optional)
        kernel used for smoothing (see parameter smooth above). Can be:
        * list or array of floats defining the kernel weights
        * one of the following strings:
          * 'boxcar' : normalized boxcar window;
          * 'hamming': normalized hamming window;
          * 'hanning': normalized hanning window;
          * 'bartlett': normalized bartlett window;
        Default: 'boxcar'

   Returns
   -------
      returns the cross-correlation histogram between x and y. The central
      bin of the histogram represents correlation at zero delay. Offset bins
      correspond to correlations at a delay equivalent to the difference
      between the spike times of x and those of y. I.e., bins to the right
      correspond to spike of y following spikes of x, and viceversa for bins
      to the left.

    Computes the cross-correlation histogram (CCH) between two spike trains.

    Given a reference spike train x and a target spike train y, their CCH
    at time lag t is computed as the number of spike pairs (s1, s2), with s1
    from x and s2 from y, such that s2 follows s1 by a time lag \tau in the
    range - or time bin - [t, t+w):

        CCH(\tau; x,y) := #{(s1,s2) \in x \times y:  t= < s2-s1 < t+w}

    Therefore, the times associated to the CCH are the left ends of the
    corresponding time bins.

    Note: CCH(\tau; x,y) = CCH(-\tau; y,x).

    This routine computes CCH(x,y) at the times
                     ..., -1.5*w, -0.5*w, 0.5*w, ...
    corresponding to the time bins
            ..., [-1.5*w, -0.5*w), [-0.5*w, 0.5*w), [0.5*w, 1.5*w), ...
    The second one is the central bin, corresponding to synchronous spiking
    of x and y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x,y : neo.SpikeTrains or lists of neo.SpikeTrains
        If x and y are both SpikeTrains, computes the CCH between them.
        If x and y are both lists of SpikeTrains (with same length, say l),
        computes for each i=1,2,...,l the CCH between x[i] and y[i] , and
        returns their average CCH.
        All input SpikeTrains must have same t_start and t_stop.
    w : Quantity
        time width of the CCH time bin.
    lag : Quantity (optional).
        positive time, specifying the range of the CCH: the CCH is computed
        in [-lag, lag]. This interval is automatically extended to contain
        an integer, odd number of bins. If None, the range extends to
        the maximum lag possible, i.e.[start-stop, stop-start].
        Default: None
    start, stop : Quantities (optional)
        If not None, the CCH is computed considering only spikes from x and y
        in the range [start, stop]. Spikes outside this range are ignored.
        If start (stop) is None, x.t_start (x.t_stop) is used instead
        Default: None
    corrected : bool (optional)
        whether to correct for the border effect. If True, the value of the
        CCH at bin b (for b=-H,-H+1, ...,H, where H is the CCH half-length)
        is multiplied by the correction factor:
                            (H+1)/(H+1-|b|),
        which linearly corrects for loss of bins at the edges.
        Default: False
    smooth : Quantity or None (optional)
        if smooth is a positive time, each bin in the raw cross-correlogram
        is averaged over a window (-smooth/2, +smooth/2) with the values in
        the neighbouring bins. If smooth <= w, no smoothing is performed.
        Default: None
    clip : bool (optional)
        whether to clip spikes from the same spike train falling in the
        same bin. If True, such spikes are considered as a single spike;
        otherwise they are considered as different spikes.
        Default: False.
    normed : bool (optional)
        whether to normalize the central value (corresponding to time lag
        0 s) to 1; the other values are rescaled accordingly.
        Default: False
    kernel : str or array (optional)
        kernel used for smoothing (see parameter smooth above). Can be:
        * list or array of floats defining the kernel weights
        * one of the following strings:
          * 'boxcar' : normalized boxcar window;
          * 'hamming': normalized hamming window;
          * 'hanning': normalized hanning window;
          * 'bartlett': normalized bartlett window;
        Default: 'boxcar'
    xaxis : str (optional)
        whether to return the times or the bin ids as the first output.
        Can be one of:
        * 'time' (default): returns the actul times of the cch
        * 'ids': returns the bin ids of the cch.
        Default: 'time'

    Returns
    -------
    counts : array of float
        array of lagged coincidences counts, representing the number of
        spike pairs (t1, t2), with t1 from x and t2 from y, such that
        t2-t1 lies in a given range (possibly smoothed or normalized).
    times : Quantity array or array of floats
        array of spike times (or array of bin ids) associated to the
        calculated counts in CCH.
